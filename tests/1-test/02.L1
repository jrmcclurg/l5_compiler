;; Simple L1 program to test function calls
;; where callee needs to restore esi/edi
(
  ;; this is the program entry point
  (:main
    (esi <- 7)
    (call :one)         ;; call the first function
    (eax <- (print esi))  ;; print "3"
  )
  ;; this is the second function
  (:two
    (esi <- 5)
    (eax <- (print esi)) ;; print "2"
    (esi <- 3)
